    "# Homework - Performance Evaluation of Diffusion models \n",
    "In this homework, you will conduct a performance comparison between two popular diffusion models: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models ([DDPM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239)) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models ([DDIM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02502)). Your task is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of these models in generating high-quality synthetic data, focusing on aspects such as image quality, computational efficiency, and training stability. You will implement both models, apply them to a common dataset, and analyze their performance using metrics like FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance). The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of DDPM and DDIM, providing insights into how their differing approaches to diffusion and denoising affect overall model performance.\n",

    "## Instructions\n",
    "Submit your assignment as Jupter notebook with all relevant execution outputs and plots visible. Please clearly indicate the relevant steps in your code using comments, such as data pre-processing, model definition, model training. Partial grades can be given for imcomplete results when the steps are clearly marked.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure you have the cloned the [course repository](https://github.com/lydiaYchen/MSGAI24).\n",
    "2. Open the interactive notebook version (hw.diffusion.ipynb) of homework from your local clone.\n",
    "3. Complete the homework by filling the code cell and answers. Please ensure that the changes are saved.\n",
    "4. Upload the notebook to the assignment in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit your assignment as a Jupyter Notebook, ensuring that all relevant execution outputs and plots are visible. Your notebook should include a clear and organized structure, with comments for each major step of the assignment. For example, your notebook may contain:\n",
    "- Data Loading: Describe and implement the steps for preparing the dataset. This homework only works on image data with pre-trained models. Thus, we do not need to conduct customized data input, normalization, or augmentation. \n",
    "- Model Definition: Define the architectures for both the DDPM and DDIM models. Understand the details on the model parameters, layers, and any other relevant configurations.\n",
    "- Performance Evaluation: Present and analyze the results of your comparison. Include plots and metrics such as FID scores and sample visualizations. Make sure these results are clearly labeled and easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to use comments throughout your code to clearly indicate the purpose of each section and the specific steps you are performing. While complete results are preferred, partial grades may be given if the steps are clearly marked and the work is well-documented.\n",

    "Comparing the inference results of DDPM (2 points) and DDIM (2 points) by generating and analyzing their intermediate sampling results. Specifically, you need to run each model through a series of diffusion steps starting from a noisy image, capturing and outputting images at specified intervals to observe how each model refines the image over time. This involves setting up both models, performing inference at regular intervals, and saving these intermediate images to visualize and compare the evolution of image quality between the two models. This task requires to capture and analyze the differences in the sampling processes of DDPM and DDIM, providing insights into their respective performance in transitioning from noise to clearer images."

    "DDIM does not change the training process of DDPM but only accelerates the sampling process. You are required to investigate the impact of varying the number of inference steps on the performance of diffusion models. Specifically, you will run experiments with both DDPM and DDIM by changing the number of diffusion steps used during the inference process. For each configuration, you will conduct multiple runs with different number of steps, analyzing how the number of steps affects image quality (3 points) and computational efficiency (3 points). By comparing the results, you will gain insights (1 points) into the trade-offs between the number of step, image quality, and processing time, thus understanding the balance for effective diffusion model performance."
